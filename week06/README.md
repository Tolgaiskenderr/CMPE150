### Q0

 Write a program that will take integers as inputs until the user enters a negative number. Then shows the user the sum of all the non-negative numbers he/she entered.
 

| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 4 7 45 9 2 0 0 5 8 -4      | 80 | 
| 1 1 0 1 -1      | 3 | 




### Q1

Write a program that will take an integer N, then prints N! (N factorial). 


| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 5     | 120 | 
| 3     | 6 | 



### Q2

    Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, .... 

    Each number is sum of the previous two numbers except the first two numbers 0 and 1 which are predefined.

Write a program which reads a positive integer number N (smaller than 50), and prints the N.th fibonacci number. 


| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 1     | 0 | 
| 3     | 1 | 
| 7     | 8 | 
| 10     | 34 | 



 ### Q3
 Write a program which reads two integers N and M (both smaller than 15, greater than 1) 
 
     then prints a rectangle with size NxM which has stars (*).
     
     
        input: 3 3
        output:   ***
                  ***
                  ***
        
        input:  4 8
        output:   ********
                  ********
                  ********
                  ********
        

 ### Q4
 Write a program which reads two integers N and M (both smaller than 15, greater than 1) 
 
     then prints a rectangle with size NxM which has stars (*) at borders, and lines (-) inside. 
     
     
        input: 3 3
        output:   ***
                  *-*
                  ***
        
        input:  4 8
        output:   ********
                  *------*
                  *------*
                  ********

### Homework.1

 Write a program that takes 2 integers and prints their greatest common divisor (GCD). 



| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 12 15     | 3 | 
| 333 111     | 111 | 
| 47 152     | 1 |



### Homework.2

 Write a program that takes 2 integers and prints their least common multiple (LCM). 
 

| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 18 12     | 36 | 
| 17 17     | 17 | 
| 255 23     | 5823 |
