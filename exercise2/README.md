## Loops

### Q1

Write a program that reads  a positive integer K and write a sequence using the rules given follow:
    
    set the first element of sequence to K.
    compute the next element as:
             half of the previous if previous is even
             three times the previous, plus one if previous is odd. 
                
Program terminates when the sequence reaches 1.

    input: 50 
    output:  50 25 76 38 19 58 29 88 44 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1


### Q2

Write a program that first asks the user for an integer, N, and then calculates three sums: 

    the sum of the even integers, 
    the sum of the odd integers, and 
    the sum of all integers from 0 to N. 
    
   However, **exclude those integers that are divisible by 3 or divisible by 4** from these sums. 

    input: 10
    output: "Total Sum = 25, Sum of Odd = 13, Sum of Even = 12"



### Q3

 Write a program to check whether a number is **Perfect number** or not.
 
     Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors/factors.
     
     e.g: 6 is the first perfect number and sum of its proper divisors, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
     
     input: 6
     output: perfect
     
     input: 7
     output: imperfect




### Q4

Write a program that reads a positive integer n and decide whether it is a narcissistic number.  A  narcissistic number is equal to its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number.

    Example: 153 is a narcissistic number since 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.
    
    
    input: 153
    output: narcissistic number
    
    
    input: 152
    output: not a narcissistic number




### Q5


Write a program to read an integer from user (N) and find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.

    input: 10
    output: 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23


### Q6

Inverted half pyramid using numbers

        1 2 3 4 5
        1 2 3 4 
        1 2 3
        1 2
        1
