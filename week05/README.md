### Q0
Write a program that takes 2 integers a and b, then prints the result of a^b (power).

| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
|    3 4  | 81 | 
|    2 10  | 1024 | 


### Q1

Write a program that will take an integer N, then prints N! (N factorial). 


| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 5     | 120 | 
| 3     | 6 | 


### Q2

Write a program that reads two characters and displays from first character to second **excluding vowels**. Assume inputs will be lower-case characters.

    input: c p
    output: c d f g h j k l m n p
    
    input: p c
    output: p n m l k j h g f d c

### Q3

Write a program that reads two numbers and prints the numbers that can be divided to 11 between them (including the numbers themselves). Assume the smaller number will be read first.

| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
|    11 77  | 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 | 
|    8 16 | 11  | 
|    2 7 |   | 

### Q4

Write a program to read a character input in a loop. Print only numbers and  exit when pressed **e** or **E**.

| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
|    a8bc!ge  | 8 | 
|    xyzzz123xttE | 123  | 
|    xyz1e2rr3xttE | 1  | 


### Homework - 1

 Write a program that will take integers as inputs until the user enters a negative number. Then shows the user the sum of all the non-negative numbers he/she entered.
 

| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 4 7 45 9 2 0 0 5 8 -4      | 80 | 
| 1 1 0 1 -1      | 3 | 



### Homework - 2

Write a program which reads an integer (smaller than 1000000)  then prints out how many of the digits are odd numbers. 


| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 23423      | 2 | 
| 24602      | 0 | 
| 5          | 1 |


### Homework - 3


    Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, .... 

    Each number is sum of the previous two numbers except the first two numbers 0 and 1 which are predefined.

Write a program which reads a positive integer number N (smaller than 50), and prints the N.th fibonacci number. 


| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 1     | 0 | 
| 3     | 1 | 
| 7     | 8 | 
| 10     | 34 | 



### Homework - 4

 Write a program that takes 2 integers and prints their greatest common divisor (GCD). 



| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 12 15     | 3 | 
| 333 111     | 111 | 
| 47 152     | 1 |
