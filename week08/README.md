###  Q1

Write a function named **fetchDigit** which takes two integers as input: **number** and **n**. 
Function should return the n.th digit (from the right) of the number as an integer. 
If the number is less than n digits, Function should return -1. 

 Then write a program which reads a positive integer z and another integer x, then print out the x.th digit of z. 
 If the input is incorrect (z doesn't have x digits), program should print "-1". 
  
    
| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 23423 3      | 4| 
| 204612 5      | 0 | 
| 52 9      | -1| 





### Q2
Write a function named toUpper which takes a char as input, and returns the upper case version of the character if it is a lower case letter. Otherwise it should return the same character. 

 Then write a program which reads a word from the user, and prints it with upper case characters. Assume valid words will be given.

### Q6

Write a function that takes an integer n and prints a square nxn with '*'s.

  input: 4
  output: 
             *
             **
             ***
             ****  
                  
                  


### Q10
Write a function that takes an integer as a parameter and computes the factorial of that integer.

Write a program to compute  the summation of each digits' factorial using factorial function. 


| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 4 | 24 | 
| 3     |  6 | 
| 43     | 30| 


### Q12

Write a function that will take an integer n, and returns 't' if it's a perfect number*. Otherwise the function should return 'f'. 

 * Perfect Number: a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. 

 Then write main appropriately to see the result.
